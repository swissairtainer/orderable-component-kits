# orderable-component-kits
_Hardware repository_

**This repository is designed for electronics lab managers who need to stock up on passive components for prototyping and repairs, especially if pre-assembled kits are unavailable.**

This repository contains commonly used resistors and capacitors, each with their manufacturer and supplier part numbers, in a format compatible with many reseller's ordering systems.
Common resellers are Mouser or Digi-Key.

When the files were created, the components were affordable, available in large quantities, and could be ordered from Mouser.

## Usage
CSV and .xlsx files are 2 versions of the same content.
Import the repo files into your basket and order.
