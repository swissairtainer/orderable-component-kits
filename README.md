# orderable-component-kits
Component kits that can be ordered: with manufacturer part number and supplier part number in an importable format.

CSV and .xlsx files are 2 versions of the same content.

These are component lists that can be imported on Mouser or Digi-Key for example and make an electronics kit.

Components could be ordered, were cheap and available in high quantity at Mouser when files were created.
